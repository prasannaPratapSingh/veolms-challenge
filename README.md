## 📡 API Module Overview

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api`.

- **`/api/auth`**: Endpoints for signing up, logging in, logging out, and refreshing tokens.
- **`/api/user`**: Manage current user profiles and fetch user information.
- **`/api/course`**: Endpoints to list courses, retrieve full course curriculums (using aggregation), and Admin-only endpoints for creating, updating, publishing, and deleting courses.
- **`/api/section`**: Admin-only endpoints for adding and managing curriculum sections within a course.
- **`/api/lesson`**: Admin-only endpoints for adding individual lessons to sections, managing video URLs, durations, and preview access.
- **`/api/enrollment`**: Endpoints for users to enroll in published courses, retrieve their enrollments, and Admin endpoints to view all enrollments across a specific course.
- **`/api/progress`**: Endpoints to track and mark specific lessons as completed, and to fetch progress across courses.

---

## 🛡 Error Handling

The application leverages a unified error-handling approach.
- `ApiError` utility throws structured HTTP exceptions.
- The global `errorHandler.ts` middleware traps all synchronous and asynchronous exceptions (managed seamlessly via `asyncHandler`), preventing crashes and consistently formatting the response payload:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error description",
  "errors": [],
  "stack": "..." // (Only in development)
}
```

---

## 🤝 Contribution Guidelines

1. **Typescript First**: Any new feature or module must have explicit interfaces or types (e.g., `feature.type.ts`).
2. **Controller/Service Separation**: Keep controllers as thin as possible. Delegate heavy business logic to dedicated services if complexity grows.
3. **Zod Validation**: Ensure every new request body/params structure is validated by a Zod schema in a `.validation.ts` file before it hits the controller. 
4. **Follow the Structure**: Create a dedicated directory inside `src/modules/` for any distinct new entity.

# Video Transcoding Pipeline Documentation

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This document details the entire video processing pipeline, from the client's initial upload request to the final HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) generation and database update.

## High-Level Architecture Overview

The VEO Learning Management System (VEOLMS) utilizes a distributed, asynchronous video transcoding pipeline to handle large video uploads and process them into an adaptive bitrate streaming format (HLS). This ensures that video playback is fast, scalable, and optimized for various network conditions.

The architecture relies on the following core components:
*   **Express REST API:** Handles authentication, presigned URL generation, and queue dispatching.
*   **Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible object storage):** Provides two distinct buckets:
    *   `R2_RAW_BUCKET`: Temporary storage for raw user-uploaded videos (`.mp4`).
    *   `R2_HLS_BUCKET`: Permanent public storage for the transcoded HLS segmented videos (`.ts` and `.m3u8`).
*   **BullMQ & Redis:** A robust queue system used to asynchronously offload heavy processing (FFmpeg) to a separate worker process.
*   **Node.js Worker & FFmpeg:** A dedicated process responsible for downloading raw videos, converting them into multiple resolutions, segmenting them for HLS, and uploading the finalized files to R2.

---

    end
```

## 2. API Endpoint Specifications

### Step 1: Request an Upload URL
The client must securely request an upload URL. This ensures the server never has to buffer the initial heavy video upload.

*   **Endpoint:** `GET /api/lesson/:lessonId/upload-url`
*   **Query Parameters:**
    *   `fileName` (string): The name of the file being uploaded (e.g., `intro.mp4`).
    *   `fileType` (string): The MIME type of the file (e.g., `video/mp4`).
*   **Access Control:** Requires a valid authentication token and Admin privileges (`isAdmin`).
*   **Behavior:** 
    1. Generates a unique `rawKey` mapping to the `R2_RAW_BUCKET`.
    2. Utilizes `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner` to create a `signedUrl` valid for 1 hour.
*   **Response:**
    ```json
    {
      "success": true,
      "statusCode": 200,
      "message": "Upload URL ready",
      "data": {
        "signedUrl": "https://<cloudflare-r2-endpoint>/raw/123/1782...-intro.mp4?X-Amz-Signature=...",
        "rawKey": "raw/123/1782...-intro.mp4"
      }
    }
    ```

### Step 2: Trigger Processing
Once the client successfully PUTs the video file to the `signedUrl` and receives a 200 OK from R2, it must notify the backend.

*   **Endpoint:** `POST /api/lesson/:lessonId/process`
*   **Body:**
    ```json
    {
      "rawKey": "raw/123/1782...-intro.mp4",
      "fileName": "intro.mp4"
    }
    ```
*   **Access Control:** Requires a valid authentication token and Admin privileges (`isAdmin`).
*   **Behavior:** 
    1. Queues a new job onto the `video-transcoding` BullMQ queue.
    2. Responds immediately with the Job ID.

## 3. Worker Process Deep Dive

The background worker operates entirely independently from the main Express API instance, ensuring CPU-intensive FFmpeg tasks do not block the event loop or affect API latency. 

> [!TIP]  
> The worker leverages `concurrency: 1` per instance to prevent running out of memory/CPU, as FFmpeg is extremely resource-intensive. If scaling is needed, you can spawn additional worker containers horizontally.

### Processing Steps (`transcode.processor.ts`)

#### 1. File Ingestion
The worker receives the `rawKey` and streams the file from the `R2_RAW_BUCKET` directly to a newly created temporary directory (`/tmp/lesson-{id}-{timestamp}/input.mp4`).

#### 2. Resolution Transcoding (FFmpeg)
The video is then parsed and transcoded via `child_process.spawn` into four standard resolutions.

### Why `spawn` over `exec`/`execSync`

When executing FFmpeg in a production environment, `spawn` is the **recommended choice** over `exec` or `execSync` for several critical reasons:

**1. Streaming Output (No Buffering)**
- `spawn` returns streams (`stdout`, `stderr`) that emit data as it becomes available
- `exec`/`execSync` buffers the entire output in memory, which can cause issues with long-running video processing
- FFmpeg can generate substantial log output during transcoding; `spawn` handles this efficiently

**2. Memory Efficiency**
- `spawn` does not buffer output, making it suitable for large video files
- `exec`/`execSync` stores entire output in memory, potentially causing `OutOfMemory` errors for large files
- With `spawn`, you can process videos of any size without memory concerns

**3. Real-time Progress Monitoring**
- `spawn` allows real-time parsing of FFmpeg progress updates from stderr
- You can extract percentage complete, current FPS, encoding speed in real-time
- Enables live progress reporting to clients or monitoring dashboards

**4. Non-blocking Execution**
- `spawn` is asynchronous and non-blocking by default
- `execSync` blocks the Node.js event loop, preventing concurrent request handling
- Even `exec` (async) buffers everything, while `spawn` streams data

**5. Better Error Handling**
- `spawn` emits `error` events for process-level issues
- You can capture both `stdout` and `stderr` separately
- Allows for better cleanup on process termination

**Example of how `spawn` is used in practice:**
```typescript
import { spawn } from 'child_process';

const ffmpeg = spawn('ffmpeg', [
  '-i', inputPath,
  '-c:v', 'libx264',
  '-preset', 'fast',
  '-crf', '22',
  '-hls_time', '6',
  '-hls_playlist_type', 'vod',
  outputSegmentPattern
]);

ffmpeg.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
  // Parse FFmpeg progress in real-time
  const output = data.toString();
  if (output.includes('time=')) {
    // Extract current encoding time and calculate percentage
    console.log('Transcoding in progress:', output.trim());
  }
});

ffmpeg.on('close', (code) => {
  if (code !== 0) {
    console.error(`FFmpeg process exited with code ${code}`);
  }
});
```

**When to use `exec`/`execSync`:**
- Short-running commands with predictable, small output
- When you need the complete output as a single string
- Simple shell commands where streaming isn't important

**When to use `spawn`:**
- Long-running processes like video/audio transcoding
- Commands that may produce large amounts of output
- When real-time progress monitoring is needed
- Production environments where memory efficiency matters

For the VEO LMS video transcoding pipeline, `spawn` ensures reliable, memory-efficient processing of videos of any size while providing visibility into the transcoding progress. 

| Name | Width x Height | Video Bitrate | Audio Bitrate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `360p` | 640 x 360 | 800 kbps | 96 kbps |
| `480p` | 854 x 480 | 1400 kbps | 128 kbps |
| `720p` | 1280 x 720 | 2800 kbps | 128 kbps |
| `1080p` | 1920 x 1080 | 5000 kbps | 192 kbps |

The FFmpeg parameters are optimized for HLS:
*   `-c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 22`: Fast CPU encoding with constant rate factor 22 for excellent visual quality.
*   `-hls_time 6`: Divides the video into perfectly sized 6-second chunk `.ts` files.
*   `-hls_playlist_type vod`: Marks the playlist as Video-On-Demand (meaning the playlist is static and won't change).

#### 3. Segment & Playlist Upload
All resulting folders (e.g., `360p/`, `480p/`) containing `.ts` segments and their respective `index.m3u8` variant playlists are uploaded to the `R2_HLS_BUCKET`.

#### 4. Master Playlist Creation
The worker generates a `master.m3u8` file mapping out the bandwidths and resolutions, allowing adaptive streaming protocols in the browser (like `hls.js` or `video.js`) to seamlessly switch resolutions based on the user's internet speed. This is uploaded to `hls/{lessonId}/master.m3u8`.

#### 5. Database Commit & Cleanup
Finally, the MongoDB connection (established upon worker start) is utilized to execute a `findByIdAndUpdate` on the Lesson document, injecting the finalized, public `videoUrl`. The `finally` block ensures that the `/tmp/` directory is recursively destroyed whether the job succeeds or fails, preventing storage bloat.

---

## 4. Configuration & Environment

The following environment variables are critical for the pipeline to function correctly:

*   **R2_RAW_BUCKET**: Bucket designated for initial MP4 uploads.
*   **R2_HLS_BUCKET**: Publicly accessible bucket designated for the finalized HLS streams.
*   **R2_PUBLIC_URL**: The custom domain attached to the HLS bucket (e.g., `https://pub-XXXX.r2.dev`).
    > [!WARNING]  
    > Ensure that `R2_PUBLIC_URL` has **no trailing slash** or path segments, as it is directly appended to. (e.g. `https://pub-XXXX.r2.dev`, not `https://pub-XXXX.r2.dev/veolms`)
*   **R2_ACCESS_KEY / R2_SECRET_KEY**: API tokens configured in Cloudflare with `Object Read & Write` scope covering *both* buckets.

---

## 5. BullMQ Options & Resilience

The `videoQueue` is configured with robust failover and retention policies:

```typescript
defaultJobOptions: {
    attempts: 3,
    backoff: { type: "exponential", delay: 5000 },
    removeOnComplete: 50,  // Keep last 50 successful logs
    removeOnFail: 50,      // Keep last 50 failure logs
}
```
If an upload to R2 fails or FFmpeg crashes, the job is retried up to 3 times using exponential backoff (e.g., 5s, 25s, 125s) before marking the job as permanently failed.

---

## 🔒 Secure Video Delivery Pipeline

To protect premium video content from unauthorized access and direct downloads, VEOLMS implements a sophisticated **Token-Based HLS Proxy** architecture.

### How It Works

1. **Short-Lived JWT Generation**: When an authenticated user attempts to play a lesson, the frontend requests a secure token from `GET /api/lesson/:lessonId/video-token`. This token encodes the specific `lessonId` and is signed using `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` with a 6-hour expiration.
2. **Backend Video Proxy**: Instead of loading the Cloudflare R2 bucket URL directly, the frontend video player hits the backend proxy at `GET /api/lesson/:lessonId/video/master.m3u8?token=...`.
3. **Dynamic Playlist Rewriting**: The backend authenticates the JWT. Once verified, it fetches the `.m3u8` playlist from the private R2 bucket using the AWS S3 SDK. Crucially, the backend parses the playlist and dynamically appends the `?token=...` parameter to every relative `.ts` chunk and sub-playlist URI.
4. **Secure Segment Streaming**: As the video player (e.g., `hls.js`) requests individual `.ts` chunks, those requests automatically include the token. The backend verifies the token and securely pipes the binary video stream directly from R2 to the client without buffering it in memory.

### Security Benefits

*   **No Public R2 Access**: The Cloudflare `R2_HLS_BUCKET` can remain completely private. The backend orchestrates all fetches using `R2_ACCESS_KEY` credentials.
*   **Segment-Level Protection**: Even if a user extracts a direct URL for a video chunk from the network tab, they cannot share it permanently—the token will expire, and the backend will reject any unauthenticated requests with a `403 Forbidden` error.
*   **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Because the token is embedded in the stream URL itself (rather than relying on HTTP Cookies), native video players on iOS Safari and smart TVs work flawlessly without cross-origin cookie restrictions.

## 📐 Architecture Overview

> **The VEO LMS frontend follows a production-grade, scalable, feature-based folder structure combined with a strict 4-Layer Architecture that enforces a clear separation of concerns across every domain of the application.**

---

## ⭐ 4-Layer Architecture — Separation of Concerns

> **This is the foundational design principle of the entire frontend codebase. Every feature module is independently organized into exactly four layers, each with a distinct, non-overlapping responsibility.**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    UI Layer                         │
│         (pages/, components/) — Rendering only      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

│          (hook/) — Bridge between UI & State        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                   State Layer                       │
│     (state/) — Redux slices, actions, selectors     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                  Service Layer                      │
│     (service/) — API calls, external integrations   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Service Layer — `service/`
The service layer is the only layer authorized to communicate with the backend API. It contains pure, framework-agnostic functions that make HTTP requests using Axios. No component or Redux action ever calls the API directly — all network traffic is routed exclusively through this layer. This makes it trivially easy to mock services in tests, swap out endpoints, or introduce request/response transformations without touching any UI or state logic.

```typescript
// Example: course.service.ts
export const fetchAllCourses = () => axiosInstance.get('/api/course');
export const fetchCourseById  = (id: string) => axiosInstance.get(`/api/course/${id}`);
```

### State Layer — `state/`
The state layer contains Redux Toolkit slices that manage domain-specific application state. Each slice defines the shape of the data, reducers for synchronous state transitions, and `createAsyncThunk` actions that delegate API calls to the service layer. This layer is entirely decoupled from the UI — it has no knowledge of components and no direct access to the DOM.

```typescript
// Example: course.slice.ts
export const getCourses = createAsyncThunk('course/getAll', async () => {
  const res = await fetchAllCourses();
  return res.data;
});
```

### Hook Layer — `hook/`
The hook layer acts as the bridge between the UI and the Redux state. Custom React hooks in this layer abstract `useSelector`, `useDispatch`, and any derived state logic away from the component layer. A component never imports Redux primitives directly — it only consumes a clean, domain-specific hook. This isolates components from state implementation details and makes refactoring the state layer entirely transparent to the UI.

```typescript
// Example: course.hook.ts
export const useCourse = () => {
  const dispatch = useAppDispatch();
  const courses  = useAppSelector(selectAllCourses);
  const load     = () => dispatch(getCourses());
  return { courses, load };
};
```

### UI Layer — `pages/` & `components/`
The UI layer is responsible solely for rendering. Pages and components consume data and actions exclusively through the hook layer. They contain no business logic, no direct API calls, and no raw Redux imports. This strict boundary ensures that UI components remain dumb, testable, and reusable.

---

## 📁 Feature-Based Folder Structure

The codebase is organized by business domain rather than by technical type. This is the feature-based (also known as domain-driven) approach to frontend architecture. Each self-contained feature module encapsulates all four layers specific to that domain, making it possible to develop, test, and reason about each feature in complete isolation.

## ✨ Key Frontend Features

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Declarative route guard components (`Protected`, `AdminOnly`, `GuestOnly`) enforce authentication and authorization at the routing level, ensuring that students, admins, and unauthenticated users each access only the surfaces appropriate to their role.
- **HLS Adaptive Video Playback**: The course player integrates `hls.js` directly with the secure Token-Based HLS Proxy from the backend, delivering adaptive bitrate streaming (360p through 1080p) with full segment-level content protection — no direct CDN links are ever exposed to the client.
- **Reactive Video Processing Status**: A dedicated `useVideoPolling` hook monitors the asynchronous transcoding pipeline in real time, providing live feedback to administrators after a video upload is dispatched for processing.
- **Interactive Curriculum Editor**: The admin Course Editor leverages `@dnd-kit` to provide an accessible, keyboard-navigable drag-and-drop interface for reordering curriculum sections and lessons — reflecting changes optimistically while persisting them to the backend.
- **Integrated Payment Flow**: The checkout experience is built on top of the Razorpay SDK, handling the full course purchase lifecycle including order creation, payment modal orchestration, and enrollment confirmation.
- **Performant Form Management**: All user-facing forms — registration, login, course creation, and profile editing — use `react-hook-form` for zero-overhead validation and minimal re-renders, paired with field-level error messaging for a polished user experience.
- **Animated Interfaces**: `framer-motion` is used for production-quality page transitions, component mount/unmount animations, and interactive feedback, contributing to a cohesive and professional visual character across the application.
- **Centralized Axios Configuration**: A dedicated Axios instance in `lib/authInstance.ts` handles JWT injection into request headers and transparent token refresh logic via interceptors, ensuring all authenticated API calls remain consistent and secure without any per-request boilerplate.
- **Type-Safe Throughout**: TypeScript interfaces for all API payloads, Redux state shapes, and component props are maintained in a dedicated `types/` directory, providing compile-time guarantees across the entire feature surface.
- **Marketing Landing Page**: A fully composed, animated public-facing marketing experience including hero section, course listings, testimonials, statistics, and a call-to-action banner — all built with modular, independently testable section components.

## 🤝 Frontend Contribution Guidelines

1. **Feature-First, Always**: Every new domain belongs in its own dedicated directory under `src/features/`. Do not add domain logic to `shared/` or `components/`.
2. **Respect the Layer Boundaries**: Components must only call hooks. Hooks must only interact with Redux. Redux actions must only call services. Services must only call the API. Crossing these boundaries violates the architectural contract.
3. **TypeScript is Non-Negotiable**: All new files must be fully typed. No `any` types without explicit justification.
4. **State via Redux Only**: Application-level state must live in Redux slices. Component-local ephemeral state (e.g., open/closed toggles) is the only acceptable use of raw `useState`.
5. **Service Abstraction**: Never use `axios` or `fetch` directly inside a component or hook. All HTTP communication must be routed through a `*.service.ts` file.
